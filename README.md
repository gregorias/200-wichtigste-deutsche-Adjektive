# 200 wichtigsten deutschen Adjektive

A collection of tools for downloading and processing adjective-pictures from
deutschlernerblog.de.

## Overview

This repo contains one executable package `tools.scrape` that downloads images
from deutschlernerblog.de

## Background

I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards to learn languages. I noticed
that deutschlernerblog.de has a collection of 100 images representing
adjectives, and I thought that they would make for good flashcards: the images
look good and placing opposite words side-by-side makes it easy to create a
clear flashcard.
